# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project
**Introduction**: Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a traditional movie rental company facing competition from streaming giants. My role as a Data Analyst is to help the Business Intelligence department with the launch strategy for their new online video service. Utilizing SQL, I will analyze various data points and answer ad-hoc business questions that they can use for their 2020 company strategy.

## Key Questions:
-	Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
-	What was the average rental duration for all videos?
-	Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
-	Where are customers with a high l ifetime value based?
-	Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?


**Data Set**: The dataset includes information on Rockbusterâ€™s film inventory, customers, and transactions, loaded into a PostgreSQL database. It's structured to reflect real-world business scenarios and relationships between different data tables.
